# project_api_about_crops_programming_4_with_python
This Python project provides a streamlined interface for querying and analyzing agricultural data. It leverages the Socrata API to retrieve agricultural data based on user-defined parameters such as department, municipality, and crop type. The retrieved data is then cleaned, and key edaphic variables are analyzed to calculate medians.
